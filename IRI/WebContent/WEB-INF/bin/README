NOTE: the docbook-tools web page is
    http://sourceware.cygnus.com/docbook-tools/

The DocBook RPMS are in
    ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/docbook-tools/docware/
these are built on Red Hat 6.0.

In the directory 
    ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/docbook-tools/docware/red-hat-5
there is some old stuff built on Red Hat 5.2.

You can also find the EDD I built for FrameMaker+SGML at
    ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/docbook-tools/docware/framemaker
This EDD is free software, but FrameMaker+SGML is not free software,
so it is not a proper solution for typesetting free software manuals.
Still, I make it available because it's available, and it can be useful
to people who need to make high-quality printouts from DocBook.
